Here is an example where a person named Jesse Pinkman filled in his 123-12-123-123 phone number and jesse@gmail.com mail, picked 1st Day to attend, chose a Workshop session and left a Hello world message via Curl
curl http://localhost/cgi-bin/submit.pl -d "firstName=Jesse&lastName=Pinkman&phone=123-12-123-123&email=jesse%40gmail.com&research=Genomics&research=Proteomics&day1=Day 1&session=Workshop&message=Hello world"

Here we can see that the person did not follow the proper email and phone format, also forgot to pick a day to attend and pick a session
curl http://localhost/cgi-bin/submit.pl -d "firstName=Jesse&lastName=Pinkman&phone=12312-123-123&email=jessegmail.com"
